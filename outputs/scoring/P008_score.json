{
  "panel_id": "P008",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations are accurate, providing correct definitions and a comprehensive list of potential causes for each abnormality.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (Platelets, INR, Albumin) were individually addressed and subsequently integrated into the discussion of possible relationships.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output effectively identifies multiple direct and indirect relationships between the abnormal labs, grouping them under plausible shared mechanisms (Liver Dysfunction, Systemic Inflammation/Severe Illness, Malnutrition/Malabsorption). It also appropriately considers the possibility of unrelated pathologies.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "All identified relationships are physiologically accurate. For example, the links between liver dysfunction and all three labs (albumin synthesis, clotting factor synthesis, hypersplenism/thrombopoietin) are correct. The mechanisms for systemic inflammation, DIC, and malnutrition/malabsorption are also accurately described.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output demonstrates minimal narrative drift. It presents multiple plausible etiologies and relationships without prematurely concluding a single diagnosis. It explicitly acknowledges the possibility of unrelated pathologies, which further reduces drift.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output consistently uses appropriate conditional language such as 'may be caused by,' 'suggests,' 'can lead to,' 'is commonly observed,' 'can sometimes indirectly affect,' and 'It is also possible, though less likely,' reflecting clinical uncertainty and avoiding definitive statements.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides excellent depth in its mechanistic reasoning. It explains the physiological roles of platelets, INR, and albumin, and details how various conditions (e.g., liver dysfunction, inflammation, DIC, vitamin K deficiency) mechanistically lead to the observed abnormalities.",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output perfectly adheres to the requested structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' with appropriate sub-headings.",
  "total_score": 25
