{
  "panel_id": "P004",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations (Glucose, Triglycerides, HDL) are accurate, providing correct definitions, associated conditions, and clinical significance.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (Glucose, Triglycerides, HDL) were addressed in both individual explanations and relationship discussions.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output effectively identifies direct physiological relationships (e.g., insulin resistance linking all three, atherogenic dyslipidemia for triglycerides and HDL) and research-supported patterns (e.g., classic pattern for metabolic syndrome, population-level studies). It also appropriately considers the possibility of unrelated causes.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "The physiological mechanisms described for the relationships are accurate, such as how insulin resistance leads to hyperglycemia, hepatic VLDL overproduction, and reduced HDL levels through increased catabolism and altered lipoprotein metabolism.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output adheres strictly to the interpretation of the provided lab values and their known relationships, avoiding unsupported assumptions, definitive diagnoses, or speculative conclusions. It even explicitly acknowledges the theoretical possibility of unrelated causes.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output consistently uses appropriate conditional language (e.g., 'suggests,' 'may indicate,' 'could be consistent with,' 'often reflect,' 'commonly associated with,' 'highly probable,' 'theoretically possible'), demonstrating an excellent understanding of clinical uncertainty.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides good depth in its mechanistic reasoning, explaining the role of VLDL production/clearance for triglycerides, HDL's role in reverse cholesterol transport, and the detailed mechanisms by which insulin resistance impacts glucose and lipid metabolism (e.g., impaired glucose uptake, hepatic VLDL overproduction, increased HDL catabolism).",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output perfectly adheres to the requested structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' with appropriate sub-bullet points.",
  "total_score": 25
