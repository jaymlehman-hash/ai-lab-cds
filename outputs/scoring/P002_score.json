  "panel_id": "P002",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) are accurate, providing correct physiological context and common clinical implications.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR) were addressed both individually and in their relationships.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output successfully identified multiple types of relationships: direct (all three indicating kidney dysfunction), inverse (Creatinine and eGFR), shared mechanistic (BUN and Creatinine accumulation), and a research-supported diagnostic tool (BUN:Cr ratio for differentiation).",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "All identified relationships are physiologically accurate and correctly described, including the inverse relationship between creatinine and eGFR, the shared mechanism of accumulation, and the utility of the BUN:Cr ratio.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output avoids unsupported assumptions. It appropriately uses conditional language when discussing potential diagnoses (e.g., Stage 3a CKD, acute kidney injury) and the utility of the BUN:Cr ratio, without making definitive claims beyond what the given labs support.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output consistently uses appropriate conditional language (\"typically indicates,\" \"commonly indicates,\" \"can also be influenced,\" \"falls within the range typically associated,\" \"can also be seen,\" \"can sometimes provide additional clues,\" \"might suggest\") demonstrating a nuanced understanding of diagnostic certainty.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides excellent depth in its mechanistic reasoning. It explains the origin and excretion of creatinine and BUN, how their accumulation relates to GFR, and the physiological basis for the inverse relationship between creatinine and eGFR, and the shared mechanism of accumulation.",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output is very well-structured with clear headings (\"A. Individual Lab Explanations,\" \"B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs\") and bullet points, making it easy to read and understand.",
  "total_score": 25
