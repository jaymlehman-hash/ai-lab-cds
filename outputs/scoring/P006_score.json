  "panel_id": "P006",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) are correct. The physiological roles and potential causes listed for each electrolyte are accurate. The inclusion of the caveat for calcium regarding total serum calcium and albumin levels demonstrates excellent clinical accuracy.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium) provided in the panel were addressed and explained.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output successfully identified the strong direct relationships between hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, and between hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. It also correctly identified the indirect relationship between hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, accurately attributing its mediation primarily to hypomagnesemia in this context.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "The physiological mechanisms described for all identified relationships are highly accurate. This includes the role of magnesium in Na+/K+-ATPase and ROMK channels for potassium, and its impact on PTH secretion, PTH resistance, and vitamin D activation for calcium.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output strictly adheres to interpreting the provided lab values and their interrelationships, avoiding any unsupported assumptions, definitive diagnoses, or treatment recommendations. The caveat for calcium further exemplifies this by highlighting a necessary piece of missing information.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output consistently uses appropriate conditional language such as 'may suggest,' 'can impair,' 'can lead to,' and 'often mediated by,' reflecting a suitable level of diagnostic uncertainty and clinical reasoning.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides excellent depth in its mechanistic reasoning. For each relationship, it details specific physiological pathways and molecular mechanisms (e.g., Na+/K+-ATPase pump, ROMK channels, PTH synthesis/secretion/resistance, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1\u03b1-hydroxylase) that explain the observed electrolyte imbalances.",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output perfectly adheres to the requested structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' with appropriate headings and bullet points.",
  "total_score": 25
