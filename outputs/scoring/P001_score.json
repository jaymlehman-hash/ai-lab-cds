  "panel_id": "P001",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations are accurate, providing relevant causes, implications, and differential considerations for the elevated values.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (Iron, Uric Acid, Systolic BP) were addressed in the individual lab explanations.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output successfully identified direct (Uric Acid and BP), indirect (Iron and BP, Iron and Uric Acid with qualifications), and overarching research-supported relationships (Shared Underlying Mechanisms).",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "The physiological mechanisms described for each relationship (e.g., uric acid-induced renal vasoconstriction, iron-induced oxidative stress, shared metabolic pathways) are accurate and appropriately qualified based on the strength of evidence.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output avoids unsupported assumptions by consistently using conditional language and clearly distinguishing between established facts, associations, and areas of ongoing research. It does not overstate causal links.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output demonstrates excellent use of conditional language ('may indicate,' 'can be,' 'suggests,' 'is considered a risk factor,' 'proposed mechanisms,' 'has been associated,' 'not firmly established,' 'some research suggesting,' 'may reflect') to appropriately reflect the certainty of the information presented.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides good depth of mechanistic reasoning for individual labs (e.g., increased absorption/release/decreased utilization for iron; production/excretion imbalance for uric acid; vascular resistance/cardiac output/arterial elasticity for BP) and for the relationships (e.g., renal vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation for relationships).",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output adheres perfectly to the required structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' with distinct bullet points for each item.",
  "total_score": 25
