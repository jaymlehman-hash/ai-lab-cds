  "panel_id": "P007",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations for WBC, Neutrophils, and Lactate are accurate, providing appropriate and comprehensive differential diagnoses for each abnormality.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All abnormal laboratory values (WBC, Neutrophils, Lactate) presented in the output were addressed with individual explanations and included in relationship discussions.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output successfully identified direct relationships (WBC and Neutrophils), indirect/physiologic relationships (WBC/Neutrophils and Lactate via inflammation/hypoperfusion), and research-supported clinical associations (WBC/Neutrophils/Lactate in sepsis severity). It also appropriately considered unrelated causes.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "The identified relationships are physiologically accurate. The explanation of how inflammation/infection leads to hypoperfusion and subsequent lactate production is correct, as is the direct link between neutrophilia and leukocytosis.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output avoids unsupported assumptions, consistently grounding its statements in established medical knowledge. It uses cautious language and even includes a section acknowledging the possibility of unrelated causes, demonstrating a lack of narrative drift.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output demonstrates excellent use of conditional language throughout, employing phrases such as 'commonly indicates,' 'can also be seen,' 'typically accompanies,' 'strongly suggests,' 'frequently observed,' 'can lead to,' 'is theoretically possible,' and 'less likely.'",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The mechanistic reasoning is deep and thorough, particularly for the relationship between WBC/Neutrophils and Lactate. It explains the cascade from acute infection/inflammation to systemic vasodilation, microcirculatory dysfunction, tissue hypoperfusion, inadequate oxygen delivery, anaerobic metabolism, and increased lactate production.",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output adheres perfectly to the required structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' as requested.",
  "total_score": 25
