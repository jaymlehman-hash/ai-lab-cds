{
  "panel_id": "P005",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations (TSH, LDL, CRP) are accurate and provide correct clinical context and implications.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal labs (TSH, LDL, CRP) are individually addressed in section A, and their potential relationships are thoroughly explored in section B.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "All relevant pairwise relationships (TSH-LDL, CRP-LDL, TSH-CRP) are identified. The output correctly distinguishes between direct physiologic relationships, interrelated risk factors, and research-supported associations.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "The physiologic accuracy of all identified relationships is high. For example, the explanation for TSH-LDL relationship (decreased LDL clearance due to reduced thyroid hormone activity) and CRP-LDL relationship (inflammation in atherosclerosis, LDL oxidation) are correct and detailed.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output avoids unsupported assumptions, sticking to established clinical knowledge and research findings. It uses appropriate caveats when mechanisms are not fully understood or when relationships are research-supported rather than universally recognized clinical guidelines.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "Appropriate conditional language is used throughout, reflecting the level of certainty in interpretations and relationships (e.g., 'suggests,' 'may not be producing,' 'can lead to,' 'research suggests,' 'may involve,' 'potentially heightened').",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The depth of physiologic and mechanistic reasoning is excellent. It explains the underlying biological processes for individual labs (e.g., TSH's role in stimulating thyroid, CRP as an acute-phase reactant) and their interrelationships in detail (e.g., thyroid hormone regulation of LDL receptors, inflammation's role in atherosclerosis and LDL oxidation).",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output is well-organized into clear sections for 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs,' enhancing readability and logical flow. The 'Overall Context' provides a good summary.",
  "total_score": 25
