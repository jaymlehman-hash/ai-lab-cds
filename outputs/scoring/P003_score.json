  "panel_id": "P003",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations for ALT, AST, and Bilirubin are accurate and provide correct physiological context and significance.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All abnormal labs (ALT, AST, Bilirubin) mentioned in the output were addressed with individual explanations and included in relationship discussions.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output successfully identified direct physiological relationships between hepatocellular injury (ALT/AST) and impaired bilirubin excretion, as well as an overarching relationship indicating shared liver dysfunction. These are highly relevant and accurate connections.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "Both identified relationships are physiologically accurate. The explanation of how hepatocellular injury compromises bilirubin processing and excretion is correct, as is the summary that all three point to liver dysfunction.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output strictly adheres to interpreting the provided lab values and their interrelationships without introducing unsupported assumptions, speculative diagnoses, or extraneous information.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output uses appropriate conditional language throughout (e.g., 'primarily indicate,' 'suggests,' 'can also reflect,' 'strongly points towards,' 'can be compromised,' 'potential underlying') reflecting the interpretive nature of lab results.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides good depth in mechanistic reasoning. It explains why ALT/AST rise (cellular injury, enzyme release), the broader distribution of AST, and the detailed bilirubin metabolism pathway (heme catabolism, uptake, conjugation, excretion) and points of impairment. The relationships also explain the 'how' (e.g., how damaged liver cells compromise bilirubin processing).",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output perfectly adheres to the required structure, clearly separating 'A. Individual Lab Explanations' and 'B. Possible Relationships Between Abnormal Labs' with appropriate sub-headings.",
  "total_score": 25
