{
  "panel_id": "P009",
  "correctness_score": 4,
  "correctness_explanation": "All individual lab interpretations and their associated physiologic mechanisms are accurate and well-explained.",
  "completeness_score": 3,
  "completeness_explanation": "All three abnormal laboratory values (CK, Creatinine, Potassium) were individually addressed and then integrated into relevant relationships.",
  "relationship_detection_score": 4,
  "relationship_detection_explanation": "The output identified three highly relevant and direct physiologic relationships (CK-Creatinine via rhabdomyolysis/AKI, CK-Potassium via cell lysis, Creatinine-Potassium via impaired renal excretion). It also provided an excellent overarching synthesis of these relationships, pointing to a classic clinical pattern.",
  "relationship_accuracy_score": 3,
  "relationship_accuracy_explanation": "All identified relationships are physiologically accurate, and the mechanistic explanations for each are correct and clear.",
  "narrative_drift_score": 3,
  "narrative_drift_explanation": "The output strictly adheres to the information provided by the lab values and their direct implications. It avoids unsupported assumptions, explicitly stating that 'other causes for each individual lab value are possible' while still highlighting the strong clinical association.",
  "certainty_score": 2,
  "certainty_explanation": "The output consistently uses appropriate conditional language (e.g., 'typically indicates,' 'can be due to,' 'can result from,' 'strongly suggests,' 'can lead to,' 'likely contributes,' 'highly suggestive') throughout, reflecting a nuanced understanding of clinical probability.",
  "mechanistic_score": 4,
  "mechanistic_explanation": "The output provides excellent depth in its mechanistic reasoning for both individual lab abnormalities and their relationships. It explains the 'why' behind the elevations and the specific physiologic pathways linking the abnormalities (e.g., myoglobin precipitation in renal tubules, intracellular potassium release, impaired renal excretion).",
  "structure_score": 2,
  "structure_explanation": "The output adheres perfectly to the requested structure, clearly separating individual lab explanations from possible relationships using distinct headings and bullet points, making it very easy to read and understand.",
  "total_score": 25
